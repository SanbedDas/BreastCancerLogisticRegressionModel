# BreastCancerLogisticRegressionModel


I have created a logistic regression model for breast cancer detection using Python. The model utilizes features such as Clump Thickness, Uniformity of Cell Size, Uniformity of Cell Shape, Marginal Adhesion, Single Epithelial Cell Size, Bare Nuclei, Bland Chromatin, Normal Nucleoli, and Mitoses. The dataset used for this project is sourced from the provided link. 10.24432/C5DW2B


The goal of the model is to predict the likelihood of breast cancer based on these features. The logistic regression algorithm is chosen for its suitability in binary classification tasks, where the aim is to distinguish between benign and malignant cases. This model can serve as a valuable tool for early cancer detection and contribute to improved medical diagnosis.
